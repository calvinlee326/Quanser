#Traffic Light Client
#Dev: Peter Martin
#Last Update: April 1, 2022
#Summary: This script calls the traffic light API using the following syntax - CommandLight.py [auto/immediate/timed/status/shutdown] [R] [Y] [G]
#e.g. 
# > CommandLight.py auto 
# will set the timing to the default of green for 30s, yellow for 2s, red for 30s

# > CommandLight.py status
# returns the status of the light where 1 = red, 2 = yellow, 3 = green

# > CommandLight.py immediate 0 1 0
# stops any other task and sets the yellow light to ON

# > CommandLight.py timing 10 3 10
# sets the timing to 10 3 10 and kicks off a thread to run the timing
